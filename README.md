# Capstone-Project-Road-Accident-Analysis
<h3>In this project we have done road accident analysis using python libraries like seaborn, matplotlib, pandas and numpy.</h3>
<ul>
<li>To do the analysis we have used some of the data files which we have stored in different variables like: df,df1,df2,df3,df4,df5,df6,df7.</li>

<li>The data from these data source was not clean so further data cleaning was done and the null values were cleaned or replaced.</li>

<li>Then we have used these data files to the data visualization and data analysis, to this we have used various functions,
suchas- iloc, filter, melt, enumerate, forloops, and many more.]</li>

<li>To create the visualization we have used sseaborn and matplotlib, with the use of these libraries we have plot few of the graphs,
such as: barplot, lineplot, pie charts and many more.</li>
</ul>
Thank you
