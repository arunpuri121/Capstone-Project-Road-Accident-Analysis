# Capstone-Project-Road-Accident-Analysis
In this project we have done road accident analysis using python libraries like seaborn, matplotlib, pandas and numpy.

To the analysis we have used some of the data files which we have stored in different variables like: df,df1,df2,df3,df4,df5,df6,df7.

Then we have used these data files to the data visualization and data analysis, to this we have used various functions,
suchas- iloc, filter, melt, enumerate, forloops, and many more.]

To create the visualization we have used sseaborn and matplotlib, with the use of these libraries we have plot few of the graphs,
such as: barplot, lineplot, pie charts and many more.

Thank you
